This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-rauc-qemuarma9 layer.
This layer was forked from https://github.com/ahmedkassem56/meta-qemuarma9 and adapted for
RAUC by Simon.minko

Dependencies
-------------
URI: https://github.com/rauc/meta-rauc.git

Disclaimer
----------
Note that this is just an example layer that shows a few possible configuration options how RAUC can be used. Actual requirements may differ from project to projects and will probably need a much different RAUC/bootloader/system configuration.

Also note that this layer is for demo purpose only and does not care about migratability between different layer revision.

I. HOW TO BUILD AND LAUNCH QEMUARMA9
------------------------------------

    1° Create a build folder
    source poky/oe-init-build-env 

    2° Add layer meta-rauc-qemuarma9
    bitbake-layers add-layer <path>/meta-rauc-community/meta-rauc-qemuarma9

    3° open file bblayer.conf and Check if layer meta-rauc-community/meta-rauc-qemuarma9 was correctly added 

    4° Edit conf/local.conf and set value qemuarma9 to variable MACHINE
    MACHINE = "qemuarma9"

    5° launch the build
    bitbake core-image-minimal

    6° Launch script launch-qemu.sh in folder : <your build folder>/tmp/deploy/images/qemuarma9


II. WHY USE SCRIPT launch-qemu.sh

script launch-qemu.sh create a virtual nic with ip 10.0.3.100 and a virtual bridge to communicate with our yocto qemuarma9 image.
Yocto set a static ip adress to Qemuarma9 image, the ip adress is 10.0.3.17

Now we can update some rootfs partition with scp or other tool
